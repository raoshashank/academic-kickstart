abstract: "Several approaches have been developed to answer specific questions that a user may have about an AI system that can plan and act. However, the problems of identifying which questions to ask and that of computing a user-interpretable symbolic description of the overall capabilities of the system have remained largely unaddressed. This paper presents an approach for addressing these problems by learning user-interpretable symbolic descriptions of the limits and capabilities of a black-box AI system using low-level simulators. It uses a hierarchical active querying paradigm to generate questions and to learn a user-interpretable model of the AI system based on its responses. In contrast to prior work, we consider settings where imprecision of the user's conceptual vocabulary precludes a direct expression of the agent's capabilities. Furthermore, our approach does not require assumptions about the internal design of the target AI system or about the methods that it may use to compute or learn task solutions. Empirical evaluation on several game-based simulator domains shows that this approach can efficiently learn symbolic models of AI systems that use a deterministic black-box policy in fully observable scenarios."
